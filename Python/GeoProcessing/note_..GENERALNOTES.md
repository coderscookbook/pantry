# Rasters and Feature Layers
Differences between rasters and feature layers:
    Data structure: Rasters are structured as grids of pixels, while feature layers are structured as discrete features or objects.

    Data type: Raster data consists of numerical values representing a measurement or attribute of each pixel, while feature layer data consists of attributes associated with each feature.

    Visualization: Rasters are typically visualized using a color ramp that assigns colors to different ranges of pixel values, while feature layers are typically visualized using different symbols for different feature types.

    Analysis: Rasters are often used for analysis tasks such as interpolation, suitability analysis, and terrain analysis, while feature layers are often used for tasks such as spatial queries, network analysis, and proximity analysis.

* Rasters and feature layers are often used together in GIS analysis and modeling workflows. For example, you might use a raster land cover map to create a polygon feature layer representing different land cover types. Or you might use a feature layer representing roads and a raster elevation model to calculate the slope and aspect of the roads.
