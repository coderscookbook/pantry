In Python, lambda is a keyword used to create anonymous or nameless functions. 
Lambda functions are one-line functions that can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

In the given code, lambda is used inside the map() function to apply a particular operation to each element of a list.

Let's break down the code:

map() is a built-in Python function that takes two arguments: a function and an iterable. 
It applies the given function to each element of the iterable and returns a new iterable with the modified values.

lambda x: x if x.islower() else " "+x is the anonymous function being passed as the first argument to map(). 
This function takes an input x, checks if it is a lowercase letter using the .islower() method, 
and returns x if it is lowercase, or returns " "+x (a space character followed by x) if it is not.

components[0] is the iterable being passed as the second argument to map(). 
It is assumed that components is a list or string of words or phrases that are separated by some delimiter (e.g., a space character).

The modified iterable returned by map() is then passed to the join() method of an empty string ''. 
The join() method concatenates all the elements of the iterable into a single string, using the empty string as a separator.

So, the overall effect of this code is to take the first word or phrase in components, and insert a space before each uppercase letter, 
effectively converting the first word or phrase from camelCase to Title Case. The modified string is then stored in the variable peril.
